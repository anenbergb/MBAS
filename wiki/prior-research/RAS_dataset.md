## Background
* The suboptimal clinical management of AF largely stems from a fundamental lack of understanding of atrial anatomy
* Clinical investigations utilizing LGE-MRI in AF patients have highlighted that the extent and distribution of atrial fbrosis can reliably predict the success of ablation procedures
* Although algorithms for the LA are very advanced, there are currently no algorithms for the RA

LGE-MRI value 
* While non-contrast MRI yields precise images, contrast MRI, particularly LGE-MRI, ofers superior clarity for detecting smaller tissue structures and assessing their extent within the surrounding tissues
* LGE-MRI scans have proven invaluable for studying atrial fbrosis
