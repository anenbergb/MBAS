Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiac MR (CMR) is a predictor of adverse cardiovascular
outcomes in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM).

The primary end points included all-cause mortality, heart failure
hospitalization, and a composite end point of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or aborted SCD.

## Introduction
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) - diverse myocardial conditions characterized by a reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function in the absence of significant coronary artery disease.
* Myocardial scar or fibrosis in patients with NICM is a substrate for re-entrant circuits and leads to ventricular dilatation and remodeling, which further predisposes the patient to heart failure and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
LGE-MRI to predict scar/fibrosis which predicts increased cardiovascular risk (in patients with cardiomyopathy).
