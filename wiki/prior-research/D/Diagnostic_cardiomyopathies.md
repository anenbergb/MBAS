## Abstract
* Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is important tool for cardiac MRI tissue characterization studies
* LGE-MRI used to diagnose and understand cardiomyopathies.
What can it diagnose?
* differential diagnosis between ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart disease
* can help make diagnosis between different cardiomyopathies
* the intramyocardial distribution and the extent can be useful for measuring the prognosis of different cardiomyopathies.

When is LGE higlighted?
* LGE highlights tissueu when a condition increases interstitial space or slows the exit of Gd, like with myocardial fibrosis. 
* LGE as marker for myocardial fibrosis in patients with chronic myocardial infarction, hyper­trophic cardiomyopathies (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, Fabry disease, and other conditions
* LGE may highlight the increased interstitial space due to interstitial oedema or tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells in patients with acute myo­carditis

## Introduction
* Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) = best diagnostic tool for evaluating morphological, functional, and tissue phenotype of cardiomyopathies
* gold standard imaging modality for the assess­ment of cardiac function and morphological parameters as wall thickness, left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes.
* LGE-MRI is the best version of CMR for tissue characterization.
### What is LGE?
Refers to both 
* the imaging technique
* the presence of myocardial hyper-enhancement in LGE images
What can it be used to diagnose?
* differential diagnosis between ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart disease
## Mechanism of LGE
* Gadolinium-based media (Gd) are extracellular contrast agent
* Injected into peripheral veins
* In normal myo­cardium, interstitium is a relatively small space and Gd stays within it only few minutes since the exit ways through venules or lymphatic vessel are very efficient
* LGE "late gadolinium enhancement" - is due to conditions that significantly increase the inter­stitial space or less frequently that slow down Gd exit
What are conditions that might slow the Gd?
* fibrosis
* collagin matrix of scar
* increased interstitial space
LGE is marker of myocardial fibrosis in the majority of cardiac conditions. Myocardial fibrosis is irreversible since human heart myocardium is permanent tissue and cannot spontaneously regenerate.

## LGE Technique
* GE is caused by the persistence of Gd in myocardial interstitial space
* Gd in an indirect contrast agent, acting by a decrease of T1 of sur­rounding hydrogen protons.

## 3D LGE Technique
* good option in order to characterized, delineate and quantify myocardial fibrosis with high spatial resolution and utilizing isotropic voxel
* useful for the study of myocardial scar tissue prior to ablation therapy

## Qualitative and quantitative assessment of LGE
* In the ischaemic pattern, LGE al­ways involves the subendocardial layer with more or less transmural extent, it is confluent and should be located in the territory of one coronary artery.
* In the non-ischaemic pattern, LGE does not fulfil the previ­ous criteria, being midwall, subepicardial or mixed, not necessarily confluent or confined to a territory of one cor­onary artery.
* For cardiomyopathies, the exact pattern of non-ischaemic LGE is important

## Conclusions

LGE remains the most important feature of cardiac MRI
and particularly in cardiomyopathies.
LGE is an important diagnostic and prognostic marker
for the evaluation of cardiomyopathies, but different as­pects of LGE have a role in different conditions as reas­sumed in Table 1.
MRI with LGE technique should be performed in every
patient with suspect of cardiomyopathy.
The lack of standardization of pulse sequence and most­ly of quantification methods are the main limitations of
LGE technique.
