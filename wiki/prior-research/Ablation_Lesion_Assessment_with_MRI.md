## Abstract
LGE can detect
* cardiac fibrosis
* ablation-induced scarring
Can be used to assess ablation lesions non-invasively
* can detect and localize gaps in ablation lines
* can reliably rule out pulmonary vein reconnection non-invasively a
* evaluate the efficacy of ventricular ablation

This review focuses on the assessment of chronic ablation lesions using
LGE-MRI and its utility in clinical practice.


## Introduction
* Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI is increasingly used to detect cardiac fibrosis in the context of arrhythmias
* Fibrosis is a hallmark of arrhythmogenic cardiac remodelling and constitutes an important substrate in both atrial and ventricular arrhythmia

## Pathology of Lesion Formation
* After the RF ablation injury, the injured myocardium will be replaced with fibrous scar tissue. Similar fibrosis for cryoablation. 
* It has been shown that scar formation and remodelling in response to MI is a dynamic and chronically sustained process that continues over years after the initial injury.
* Fibroblasts in the myocardium continue to send fibrogenic signals and promote fibrosis
There may be long term remodeling (additional fibrosis) stimulated by ablation lesions.

## LGE-MRI for Detection of Ablation-induced Fibrosis
## Image Post-processing
To date there is no standardised method for LGE
image acquisition, and the same applies to image post-processing and
analysis, which may explain the limited reproducibility across different
centres. Most importantly, as T1-weighted imaging is based on signal
intensity contrast rather than directly measured absolute values, LGE
quantification requires a consistent internal reference for normalisation as
well as validated signal intensity thresholds discriminating healthy and
scar tissue.

# Timing of Lesion Assessment
Goial of measuring the "chronic lesion formation in the atrium and in the ventricle".

The ablation lesion formation is dynamic, sustained ... takes a while to set in. 
* measuring atrial ablation lesions with LGE is best performed 3 months post ablation, rather than later >12 months. 
* Taking the LGE MRI image too soon after the ablation could meant hat LGE just reflects the oedema (transient inflammatory response) which usually resolves within the first month following teh ablation.

They have observed decreased detectability of atrial ablation lesions at very late time point > 12month post-ablation
* This could mean that the ablation-induced fibrosis didn't hold. And could mean that Afib returns. 
* The long-term decrease in LGE of pulmonary vein (PV)-encircling ablation lesions

## Atrial Ablation Lesion
## LGE-MRI of the Atrium
* LGE-MRI is used for studying Ventricular tachycardia ablation (VT ablation)

It's difficult to use LGE-MRI for measurement of fibrosis in atrium because
1. atrial fibrosis is typically less extensive and more diffuse. (unlike the case of an extensive big post-MI scar). Makes it difficult to detect the scars. conventional T1-
weighted MRI relies on differential spatial contrast between normal tissue
on one side and abnormal tissue on the other side.
2. Differentiation of spatial contrast is difficult in thin-walled atrium with wall thickness down to 1 mm, which is the limit of spatial resolution of MRI. Improved MRI resolutions can help with this.

## Lesion Assessment to Predict Ablation Outcome
* use LGE-MRI to measure teh presence of gaps in teh lesions -> could predict A Fib recurrrance.

## Conclusion
LGE-MRI constitutes the gold standard for non-invasive ablation lesion
assessment. In the context of atrial ablation, LGE-MRI-based lesion
assessment is already employed in routine clinical settings for non-
invasive confirmation of durable PVI and to guide repeat ablation
procedures in selected centres. In contrast, ventricular lesion assessment
by LGE-MRI is less well established. However, despite the lack of clinical
validation, LGE-MRI-based evaluation of arrhythmogenic substrate
elimination holds great promise as an efficacy endpoint for VT ablation
and a potential predictor of recurrences and clinical outcome.

## Clinical Perspective
* Late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE)-MRI offers the unique
capability of non-invasive ablation lesion assessment.
* LGE-MRI can detect and localise functional gaps in atrial lesion
sets with high accuracy, which also allows for MRI-guided repeat
ablation.
* Because of a very high negative predictive value regarding the
detection of functional gaps, LGE-MRI can reliably rule out
pulmonary vein reconnection non-invasively and may thus avoid
unnecessary invasive repeat procedures where a pulmonary-
vein-isolation-only approach is pursued.
* Elimination of LGE-MRI-detected arrhythmogenic substrate may
serve as a potential efficacy endpoint and predictor of clinical
outcomes in ventricular tachycardia ablation.
